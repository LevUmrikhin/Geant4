Here's my update for the QD simulation. I've used Omri's scintillation parts but moved everything otherwise out of exampleB4 such that we have better control of what is accessible.

The information saved is the std::vector of wavelengths that hit the PMT in a TTree.

I've attached 2 examples in the example directory:
1) default-1357
This should be a reproduction what Omri's code originally did. There is a plotting script which accounts for efficiency and we see much more photons that expected.
2) yield-1
I've tried playing with the ScintillationYield, and only if we lower it a LOT, do we get reasonable hits. This is an example with it set to 1 per MeV and is much more in line with what we see, but of course I have no idea what is correct.

To reproduce:
1) Edit mptScint->AddConstProperty("SCINTILLATIONYIELD", 1357./MeV) in DetectorConstruction
2) Go into the build directory and compile:
cmake ..
make
3) Change the beamOn number in test.mac
4) Run via:
./sim -m test.mac -t 8
5) Plot via:
root
.x plot.C
